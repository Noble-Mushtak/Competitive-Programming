# Google Code Jam #
This is where I store my entries to the [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam) contest.

For solutions not in a folder, the links to what problem each file solves can be found in a comment of the code itself.

For solutions in a folder, the past contest can be found [here](https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html). The solutions I have might not be correct because these folders are an archive of my actual final submissions to the Google Code Jam contest.
