# USACO (C) #
This is where I store my C entries to the USACO contest. You can download the files here and test them out on your own computer by adding in adjacent IN and OUT files in the directory of the compiled code.

For solutions not in a folder, the links to what problem each file solves can be found in a comment of the code itself (except for <code>milk6.c</code>, which is an [USACO training site](http://train.usaco.org/) problem).

For solutions in a folder, the past contest can be found from [here](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests) (or at [the USACO homepage](http://www.usaco.org/) if the contest is very recent). The solutions I have might not be correct because these folders are an archive of my actual final submissions to the USACO contest. Alternate solutions outside of folders (i.e. "ccski2.c") may also not be correct.
